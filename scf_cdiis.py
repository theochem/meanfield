           **Optional arguments:**

           maxiter
                The maximum number of iterations. When set to None, the SCF loop
                will go one until convergence is reached.

           threshold
                The convergence threshold for the wavefunction

           skip_energy
                When set to True, the final energy is not computed. Note that some
                DIIS variants need to compute the energy anyway. for these methods
                this option is irrelevant.

           prune_old_states
                When set to True, old states are pruned from the history when their
                coefficient is zero. Pruning starts at the oldest state and stops
                as soon as a state is encountered with a non-zero coefficient. Even
                if some newer states have a zero coefficient.
