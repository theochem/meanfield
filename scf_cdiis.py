    '''Minimize the energy of the wavefunction with the CDIIS algorithm

       **Arguments:**

       ham
            A Hamiltonian instance.

       **Optional arguments:**

       maxiter
            The maximum number of iterations. When set to None, the SCF loop
            will go one until convergence is reached.

       threshold
            The convergence threshold for the wavefunction

       prune_old_states
            When set to True, old states are pruned from the history when their
            coefficient is zero. Pruning starts at the oldest state and stops
            as soon as a state is encountered with a non-zero coefficient. Even
            if some newer states have a zero coefficient.

       skip_energy
            When set to True, the final energy is not computed.

       scf_step
            The type of SCF step to take after the interpolated states was
            create from the DIIS history. This can be 'regular', 'oda2' or
            'oda3'.

       **Raises:**

       NoSCFConvergence
            if the convergence criteria are not met within the specified number
            of iterations.
