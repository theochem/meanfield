       overlap
            The overlap operator.

       core1, core2, ...
            A number of operators that add up to the core Hamiltonian. Any set
            of operators whose sum resembles a Fock operator is fine. Usually,
            one passes the kinetic energy and nuclear attraction integrals.

       exp1, exp2, ...
            A list of wavefunction expansion objects (output arguments)

       This method only modifies the expansion coefficients and the orbital
       energies.
